The Project “Nutritional Planner” came up as an extraordinary high-
scope application-based project idea for our Java project, that we had
to demonstrate for Semester A. The primary objective of this project
design is to produce an accurate plan for food diet for an individual,
according to their preferences and personalization.

This project is done in Collaboration with my mate "Ip Tsun Ting".
